# Nerves.MDNS

A mDNS (Bonjour) service for the Nerves platform. The real Bonjour (mDNSReponder)
binaries are used, to provide 100% compatibility.

## Installation

Once [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `nerves_mdns` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:nerves_mdnsd, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/nerves_mdns](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves_mdns).


Nerves.MDNS also provides an interface to Apple's Bonjour DNS Service Discovery
implementation. Bonjour allows applications to browse, resolve and register
network services via link-local multicast DNS on the local network and via
unicast DNS over the internet. In the later case if the service is running
behind a NAT gateway Bonjour will only advertise it if a port forward can be
negotiated via NAT-PMP or uPNP (which is attempted automatically).

### Prerequisites

Erlang R19 or later.

Apple Bonjour or a compatible API such as [Avahi](http://avahi.org/) with it's
compatibility layer along with the appropriate development files:

* OS X - bundled
* Windows - [Bonjour SDK](http://developer.apple.com/opensource/)
* BSD/Linux - search for Avahi in your operating systems software manager
* Ubuntu - apt-get install avahi-daemon libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev

### Build Process

Build with [rebar](https://github.com/basho/rebar):

* compile: `rebar compile`
* test: `rebar eunit`
* edoc: `rebar doc`

If you are running Linux with Avahi you will need Avahi's Bonjour compatibility
layer installed. If `{error,-65537}` is returned when starting an operation
it may be that avahi-daemon is not running.

If you are running Windows you will need Visual Studio and the Bonjour SDK
installed. The project can then be built from a Visual Studio command prompt.

### Example use

    Eshell V5.8.2  (abort with ^G)
    1> dnssd:start().
    ok

First start the application via `dnssd:start/1` or `application:start(dnssd)`.

### Browsing for Services

    2> dnssd:browse("_http._tcp").
    {ok,#Ref<0.0.0.197>}

In the success case, all functions return a tuple of the form `{ok, Reference}`.
Reference should be retained to pass to `dnssd:stop/1` when no further results
are required.

    3> flush().
    Shell got {dnssd,#Ref<0.0.0.197>,
                     {browse,add,
                             {<<"dnsndnsweb">>,<<"_http._tcp.">>,
                              <<"bonjour.tj.id.au.">>}}}
    Shell got {dnssd,#Ref<0.0.0.197>,
                     {browse,add,{<<"TIVO">>,<<"_http._tcp.">>,<<"local.">>}}}
    ok

Results will be sent in tuples of the form
`{dnssd, Reference, {Operation, Change, Result}}`. Reference will be the same
reference which was used to start the operation. Operation will be one of the
atoms `browse`, `resolve`, `register` or `enumerate`. Change will be the atom
`add` or `remove` and the result will be an operation specific term. For the
browse operation, it will be a tuple containing binaries of the form
`{ServiceName, ServiceType, Domain}`.

    4> dnssd:browse(<<"_http._tcp">>, <<"dns-sd.org">>).
    {ok,#Ref<0.0.0.488>}
    5> flush().
    Shell got {dnssd,#Ref<0.0.0.488>,
                     {browse,add,
                             {<<" * Apple, makers of the iPod">>,
                              <<"_http._tcp.">>,<<"dns-sd.org.">>}}}
    Shell got {dnssd,#Ref<0.0.0.488>,
                     {browse,add,
                             {<<" * Google, searching the Web">>,
                              <<"_http._tcp.">>,<<"dns-sd.org.">>}}}
    %% snipped %%
    ok

Browsing can be limited to a specific domain by specifying the domain as
argument two. Both domains and service types may be specified as lists or
binaries.

### Resolving a Service Instance

    6> dnssd:resolve(<<" * DNS Service Discovery">>, <<"_http._tcp.">>, <<"dns-sd.org.">>). 
    {ok,#Ref<0.0.0.20357>}

To resolve a service, supply it's name, registration type and domain to the
resolve function.

    7> flush().
    Shell got {dnssd,#Ref<0.0.0.20357>,
                     {resolve,{<<"dns-sd.org.">>,80,
                               [{<<"txtvers">>,<<"1">>},{<<"path">>,<<"/">>}]}}}
    ok

Unlike the other operations results won't be tagged add or remove as the
underlying DNSSD API does not provide this information. As resolve is generally
called just prior to connecting to a service this shouldn't pose a problem. The
Result term for this operation is a tuple of the form
`{Hostname, Port, TxtStrings}` where Hostname is a binary, Port is an integer
and TxtStrings is a list containing either binaries or should a given string
contain an equals sign, a `{Key, Value}` tuple wherein Key is everything up to
the first equals sign and the remainder of the string is the value.

    8> dnssd:resolve_sync(<<" * DNS Service Discovery">>, <<"_http._tcp.">>, <<"dns-sd.org.">>).
    {ok,{<<"dns-sd.org.">>,80,[<<"txtvers=1">>,<<"path=/">>]}}

A synchronous wrapper to resolve is also provided. A timeout in milliseconds can
also be specified by adding a fourth argument. The default timeout is 5 seconds.
`{error, timeout}` will be returned should the operation timeout.

### Registering Services

    9> dnssd:register("_answer._udp",42).
    {ok,#Ref<0.0.0.10006>}
    10> flush().
    Shell got {dnssd,#Ref<0.0.0.10006>,
                     {register,add,
                               {<<"atj-mbp">>,<<"_answer._udp.">>,<<"local.">>}}}
    ok

The minimum arguments needed to register a service are the service type and
port. If no service name is supplied, the machines name is used (in the example
above, that's `<<"atj-mbp">>`). The Result term for this operation is a tuple
containing binaries of the form `{ServiceName, ServiceType, Domain}`.

For brevity, the alternative invocations of register are:

    dnssd:register(Name, Type, Port).
    dnssd:register(Type, Port, Txt).
    dnssd:register(Name, Type, Port, Txt).
    dnssd:register(Name, Type, Port, Txt, Host, Domain).

Wherein:

 * `Txt` is a TXT record data in either binary form (a sequence of
`<<Size, String:Size/binary>>`), a list of atoms, strings or binaries or tuples
of the form {Key,Value} where Key and Value are atoms, strings or binaries.
 * `Host` is the hostname of the machine running the service. Pass an empty
string or binary for the local machine.
 * `Domain` is the domain to register the service within. Pass an empty string
or binary for all domains.

***Note:*** A service may be renamed if it conflicts with another service. Check
the Results tuple to determine what name a service has been assigned.

#### Local Registrations

If `localhost` is passed as Host to `dnssd:register/6` the service will be
registered only in the local domain (regardless of the Domain argument) and only
on the local machine.

### Enumerating Domains

    11> dnssd:enumerate(browse).
    {ok,#Ref<0.0.0.15448>}
    12> flush().
    Shell got {dnssd,#Ref<0.0.0.15448>,{enumerate,add,<<"local.">>}}
    Shell got {dnssd,#Ref<0.0.0.15448>,{enumerate,add,<<"bonjour.tj.id.au.">>}}
    ok
    13> dnssd:enumerate(reg).
    {ok,#Ref<0.0.0.15529>}
    14> flush().
    Shell got {dnssd,#Ref<0.0.0.15529>,{enumerate,add,<<"local.">>}}
    Shell got {dnssd,#Ref<0.0.0.15529>,{enumerate,add,<<"bonjour.tj.id.au.">>}}
    ok

The Result term for this operation is a binary containing the browse or
registration domain.

### Stopping Operations

It's important to stop operations when no more results are needed to avoid
generating needless network traffic. To stop an operation pass the Reference
returned when you started the operation to `dnssd:stop/1`. Operations will also
be stopped if your process exits.

### Retrieving Results

Results from a running operation can be retrieved by calling
`dnssd:results(Ref)`. For resolve operations this will only return the last
result. For all other operations it will return all current results.
